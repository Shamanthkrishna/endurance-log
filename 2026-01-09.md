## Summary
- **Distance:** 4.5 km  
- **Duration:** 54 min 46 sec  
- **Avg Pace:** 12:12 / km  
- **Steps:** 6,147  
- **Calories:** 320 kcal

## Heart Rate Metrics
- **Average HR:** 131 bpm  
- **Peak HR:** 184 bpm  
- **Avg Cadence:** 113 spm  

### HR Zone Distribution
- Normal: 23%  
- Warm-up: 13%  
- Fat Burning: 19%  
- Aerobic: 22%  
- Anaerobic: 16%  
- Extreme: 7%

Significant time spent above aerobic zone despite the session being classified as a walk.

## Pace & Effort Analysis
- Strava shows intermittent faster segments (~7:30–8:15 / km), likely brisk walking or short jog bursts.
- Multiple pace drops indicate frequent slowing or recovery phases.
- Effort profile was **uneven**, with sharp HR spikes rather than smooth aerobic control.

---

## Key Observations
- Heart rate spiked aggressively for a relatively short total distance.
- Peak HR of 184 bpm is **disproportionately high** for a walk-dominant session.
- Cardiovascular load was higher than Day 02 despite shorter duration.
- Indicates either:
  - Overreaching after consecutive days, or
  - Poor intensity control during faster segments.

---

## Takeaway
This was **not a recovery session**, even though distance and duration were lower. High heart-rate spikes suggest reduced recovery or excess intensity. While volume was modest, cardiovascular stress was elevated. This session highlights the need for stricter HR discipline on non-jog days.

---

## Next Session Focus
- Enforce an upper HR cap.
- Keep effort conversational throughout.
- If fatigue persists, prioritize a true low-intensity recovery walk.
