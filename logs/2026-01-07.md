**Date:** 2026-01-07  
**Location:** Urban lake loop  
**Session Type:** Walk dominant with short jog intervals  

---

## Summary
- **Distance:** 7.13 km  
- **Duration:** 76 min 31 sec  
- **Avg Pace:** ~10:00 / km (mixed)  
- **Steps:** 7,995  
- **Calories:** ~416 kcal  

---

## Heart Rate Metrics
- **Average HR:** 134 bpm  
- **HR Zones Distribution:**
  - Warm-up: 19%
  - Fat Burn: 31%
  - Aerobic: 31%
  - Anaerobic: 16%
  - Extreme: 1%

Majority of the session stayed in **fat-burn + aerobic zones**, indicating a controlled endurance-focused workout.

---

## Pace & Effort Analysis
- Fastest km recorded around **6:30 / km**, indicating short jog bursts.
- Multiple slow kms (10–12 min/km) confirm walk recovery phases.
- Pace variability was intentional and sustainable, not erratic fatigue-driven slowdown.

---

## Cadence
- **Average Cadence:** ~105 spm (walk-heavy)
- Jog segments showed higher cadence spikes, but overall cadence reflects endurance walking rather than continuous running.

---

## Subjective Observations
- Breathing was controlled throughout most of the session.
- Heart rate recovered quickly after faster segments.
- No sharp knee pain reported during or after the session.
- Energy levels remained stable till the end — no crash.

---

## Takeaway
This was a **low-risk aerobic base session** focused on consistency and cardiovascular conditioning rather than speed. The duration and HR stability indicate good endurance tolerance. Priority remains building volume first before increasing continuous jog time.

---

## Next Session Focus
- Slightly increase jog-to-walk ratio.
- Keep HR mostly under aerobic threshold.
- Maintain duration; avoid chasing pace.
