**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Session Type:** Extended aerobic endurance walk  
**HR Source:** Fastrack smartwatch  
**Distance Source:** Strava GPS

## Summary
- **Distance:** 6.36 km  
- **Moving Time:** 79 min 18 sec  
- **Avg Pace:** 12:28 / km  
- **Steps:** ~8,090  
- **Calories:** ~428 kcal  

---

## Heart Rate Metrics
- **Average HR:** 123 bpm  
- **Peak HR:** ~146 bpm  
- **Avg Cadence:** ~94 spm  

### HR Zone Distribution (Fastrack)
- Warm-up: 31%  
- Fat Burning: 57%  
- Aerobic: 9%  
- Anaerobic: 3%  
- Extreme: 0%

Majority of time spent in **fat-burning and low aerobic zones**, appropriate for endurance development.

---

## Pace & Control
- Pace remained steady between ~11:30–13:00 / km.
- No sustained HR spikes despite long duration.
- Cadence slightly low, indicating relaxed but heavy steps toward the end.

---

## Key Observations
- HR remained mostly controlled for ~80 minutes.
- Small HR rises occurred late in the session, likely fatigue-related.
- No forced stops; movement was continuous.
- Session felt sustainable despite duration.

---

## Takeaway
This was a **proper endurance-building session**. Long duration combined with controlled average heart rate directly supports trekking demands. Slight late-session HR drift suggests fatigue accumulation from multiple sessions in the same day, not loss of fitness.

---

## Next Session Focus
- Avoid doubling long sessions in one day.
- Maintain cadence above 100 spm to reduce late-session fatigue.
- Prioritize recovery before next intensity exposure.
