# Day 09 – Walk + Controlled Jog Exposure

**Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Session Type:** Brisk walk with short continuous jog  
**HR Source:** Fastrack smartwatch  
**Distance Source:** Strava GPS  

---

## Summary
- **Distance:** 4.49 km  
- **Moving Time:** 48 min 13 sec  
- **Avg Pace:** 10:44 / km  
- **Steps:** ~5,700  
- **Calories:** ~295 kcal  

---

## Heart Rate Metrics
- **Average HR:** 128 bpm  
- **Peak HR:** ~158 bpm  
- **Avg Cadence:** ~113 spm  

### HR Zone Distribution (Fastrack)
- Warm-up: 43%  
- Fat Burning: 15%  
- Aerobic: 23%  
- Anaerobic: 17%  
- Extreme: 0%

Significant time spent above aerobic zone during the jog segment.

## Session Breakdown
- First ~2 km: brisk walking (controlled)
- Next ~1 km: continuous slow jog (~8:11 / km)
- Final segment: walk recovery

Jog segment was completed **without stopping** and without perceived distress.

---

## Key Observations
- Continuous 1 km jog felt mechanically easy.
- No urge to stop or take rest during jog.
- HR rose to 140–160 bpm during jogging despite slow pace.
- HR dropped again once walking resumed, indicating recovery ability.

---

## Takeaway
This session confirms improving movement economy and mental comfort with continuous jogging. However, the heart-rate response shows that jogging is still **cardiovascularly expensive**. This was a useful exposure, not a fitness benchmark. Trek readiness is driven by low average HR over long durations, not short jog tolerance.

---

## Next Session Focus
- Prioritize low-HR walking.
- Use jogging sparingly and only as controlled exposure.
- Avoid stacking high-HR days consecutively.
